===============================================================
This repository presents a verification test case for a master implementation of the Two-Wire Serial Register Interface based on Systemverilog Object Oriented concepts and also UVM. The general architecture and implementation of the code has been taken from the UVM primer (Ray Salemi):

https://github.com/rdsalemi/uvmprimer

and also partly from:

http://www.asic-world.com/examples/systemverilog/uart.html

However the presented verification code in this test case is manipulated to be fitted for the special use case of the Two-Wire Serial Register Interface.
